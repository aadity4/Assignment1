Introduction:<br>
Our course started on 3rd January 2022.  It was a little hard for me to catch up on the rules and regulations of the class. Before joining the course I was a little bit afraid that web developing is very tough, but after joining It was so much fun. I’m enjoying coding. Also, the tutor, who was/is always there with so much energy to teach us new things and help out in every situation helped me to have a better experience from the very first day of my class. <br>
Assignment :<br>
The assignment seemed to be difficult at the initial but it was fun to do afterward. This assignment has helped me a lot to understand more about web development, coding, design, and debugging process as I researched and watched many tutorial videos, books, websites, etc., related to web development. I’ve written most of the codes through my understanding and experiment, whereas 90% of the ideas were taken from our course slides and classes. (csy1018, n.d.) The code for hiding the menu behind the hamburger icon in the CSS file from lines no.8 to 89 was taken from the website named codepen. (Powell, n.d.)<br>
The web pages contain a homepage, a portfolio page, a blog page, a contact page, and a report page. All the web pages have the same layout. The grid layout has been used and all the pages are responsive. I tried to make the website for my gym.  Chartreuse color is used as it looked good in the black background image(free) which I had downloaded from Pixabay. (Fehre, 2017). A logo image inserted in the homepage was also downloaded from the same website. (Things, 2015). Perhaps, I’ll be working on this project furthermore and make it workout for my gym shortly.<br>
On the whole, the learning experience was easy on the eyes. I learned a lot. I believe the motive of this assignment was to make us more familiar with using CSS and Html. And I also believe every one of us has been comfortable using Html, CSS, Github after this assignment.<br></h2>
